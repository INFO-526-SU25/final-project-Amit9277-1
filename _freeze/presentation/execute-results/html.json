I combined all 4 charts in one.\n:::\n:::::\n\n## General Census\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\nThe general census shows that 3 out of top 4 peaks attempted for expedition shows fairly positive results around 90% success rate.\n\n-   Now we will see what role does choice of route plays here....\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=3300}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Plot Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/Combined all plots for second visualization-1.png){width=3300}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Observations\n\n-   [**Dominant Route Preference:**]{.underline} A significant majority of attempts concentrated on a single, well-established route for this peak.\n-   [**Marginal Alternate Success:**]{.underline} While other routes were attempted, their success rates or popularity were considerably lower, highlighting a clear preference for the primary path.\n-   [**Strategic Path-Peak Selection:**]{.underline} Top-performing nations consistently favored a specific path-peak combination, indicating that **route selection is a critical determinant of expedition success**.\n-   [**Inherent Route Bias:**]{.underline} The observed pattern reflects a historical trend where a particular route, proven over years, emerged as the most reliable for success by 2020-2024 dataset.\n\n# Question 2\n\n# Question 2:\n\nDo certain Agencies have a higher number of member/personal deaths than others with respect to season/date?\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nIntroduction:\n\n-   Do Himalayan expidition fatality corellate with any Agencies? If so, further research could look into the safety guidelines of the more fatal agencies and why they occur.\n\n-   Are fatalities more common in certain seasons?\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nApproach:\n\n-   First, look at number of fatal expeditions by agency\n\n-   Next, visualize and compare agencies by percent fatality and season.\n\n-   Lastly, see if the percent misrepresents the raw number.\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Agencies that have at least 1 fatal expedition between 2021-2024\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/graph death by agency Q2-1.png){width=3300}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Zoom In: 2021\n\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## 2021 Percent Deaths\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/percent deaths 2021-1.png){width=3300}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2021 Actual Deaths\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/sum deaths 2021-1.png){width=3300}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Zoom In: 2022\n\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## 2022 Percent Deaths\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/percent deaths 2022-1.png){width=3300}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2022 Actual Deaths\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/sum deaths 2022-1.png){width=3300}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Zoom In: 2023\n\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## 2023 Percent Deaths\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/percent deaths 2023-1.png){width=3300}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2023 Total Deaths\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/sum deaths 2023-1.png){width=3300}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Zoom In: 2024\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## 2024 Percent Deaths\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/percent deaths 2024-1.png){width=3300}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2024 Total Deaths\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/sum deaths 2024-1.png){width=3300}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Observations\n\n-   Seven Summit Trekks had the most expeditions that had at least one fatality but often were not the most fatal per individual treks, and had low percentage of fatalities for each expedition.\n-   Spring was significantly more deadly than Autumn\n-   2022 and 2023 had more deaths than 2021 and 2024\n-   Slightly more Hiker fatality than Staff fatality\n\n# Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Directions\n\n## Key Limitations\n\n-   [**Data Quality**]{.underline}**:** Initial dataset required extensive cleanup due to inconsistencies (e.g., consolidated route information in one column instead of four).\n\n-   [**Data Sparsity**]{.underline}**:** High variable count relative to entries limited conclusive findings.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n-   **In-depth Dataset Exploration:** Our team intends to expand our analysis by leveraging the more comprehensive data available in the original dataset's second edition, accessible at: <https://www.himalayandatabase.com/hbn2019.html> This will enable a deeper investigation into the insights observed in the current smaller dataset.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n-   The overwhelmingly dominant and historically proven route is the preferred and most successful path for this peak, with top-performing nations consistently prioritizing it due to its critical role in expedition success. Alternate routes are notably less effective.\n\n-   If you go on a Himalayan expedition, don't do so with Seven Summit Treks in the Spring\n\n## Images\n\n![Image credit: Raimond Klavins, Unsplash Royalty Free Images.](images/raimond-klavins-L6jxljMeUoo-unsplash.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"500\"}\n\n# Thank you.\n",
