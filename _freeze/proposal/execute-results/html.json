The large amount of time data inspired us to think about potential time series visualizations and the variables present allowed for diverse questions from analysis of lethality to the impact of hiker background.\n\n## Questions\n\nQ1: Are certain routes favored by expeditions from particular nations, and do they have disparate success rates?\n\nQ2: Do certain Agencies have a higher number of member/personal deaths than others with respect to season/date?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n#### Q1 Plan:\n\nWe’ll first count, for each country, how many times each route was attempted and how many of those attempts succeeded. Then we’ll make a bar chart where:\n\n-   **X-axis** is the route name (categorical)\n\n-   **Y-axis** is the number of attempts (numeric)\n\n-   **Bar fill** shows the success rate (e.g. darker = higher percentage of summits)\n\n-   **Facets** split the chart by nation so each country has its own panel\n\nThis layout lets us instantly see which routes each country prefers (tallest bars) and how well they do on them (color intensity). We can then tweak—say, switch to a heatmap of nation vs. route with attempts as tile size and success rate as color—if we want another perspective.\n\nThe variables involved in this graph are as follows:\n\nExisting variables:\n\nNATION (Categorical) - Principle nationality.\\\nROUTE1,...,ROUTE4 (Categorical) - Climbing route.\\\nSUCCESS1,....,SUCCESS4 (Binary/Numeric) - Success on route.\n\nNew variables to be created:\n\nROUTE (categorical) - A single “long” route identifier created by pivoting ROUTE1–ROUTE4 into one column.\\\nSUCCESS (binary/numeric) - Corresponding to each ROUTE, the matching SUCCESS flag (0 = fail, 1 = success).\\\nATTEMPTS (numeric) - Count of expeditions per (NATION, ROUTE) pair.\\\nSUCCESS_RATE (numeric, 0-1) - For each (NATION, ROUTE):\n\n$$\n\\text{success\\_rate} = \\frac{\\text{total successes}}{\\text{total attempts}}\n$$\n\n#### Q2 Plan:\n\nWe anticipate that the best way to answer this question is to have a graph with percent death (color by either Hiker or Personnel) by agency. These graphs will be faceted by season. So far, a bar graph is the anticipated result though we are open to trying different types of graphs.\n\nThe variables involved in this graph are as follows:\n\nExisting variables:\\\n\\\nAGENCY - Trekking agency\\\nMDEATHS - Member deaths (per trip)\\\nTOTMEMBERS - total members (per trip)\\\nHDEATHS - hired personnel deaths (per trip)\\\nTOTHIRED - total hired personnel (per trip)\\\nYEAR - year\\\nSEASON - season\n\nNew variables to be created:\\\n\\\nPMDEATHS - MDEATHS/TOTMEMBERS - percent member deaths\\\nPHDEATHS - HDEATHS/TOTHIRED -\\\npercent personnel deaths\\\nPTOTDEATHS - (HDEATHS + MDEATHS)/(TOTHIRED + TOTMEMBERS) - percent total deaths\n\n## Plan of Attack\n\n| Task Name | Assignee | Status | Due | Priority | Summary |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------------|\n| Prepare Proposal | Cat & Amit | Done | 2025-06-10 | High Priority | Collaboratively select a dataset and define two research questions.

Consult Amit for any major decisions on data handling. |\n| Creating New Variables | Amit | To-Do | 2025-06-19 | Moderate Priority | Create derived variables for analysis based on research questions. Share variable definitions with Cat for feedback. |\n| Creating Draft of the Graph | Cat | To-Do | 2025-06-21 | Moderate Priority | Develop initial visualizations for the two research questions. Share drafts with Amit for input. |\n| Meeting to Discuss Graph Edits | Cat & Amit | To-Do | 2025-06-21 | Low Priority | Meet to review graph drafts, discuss improvements, and agree on final visualization approach. |\n| Polishing the Graph | Amit | To-Do | 2025-06-22 | Moderate Priority | Refine visualizations based on meeting feedback. Ensure clarity and alignment with research questions. |\n| Write-Up of Analysis and Code | Cat | To-Do | 2025-06-25 | Moderate Priority | Write explanations for code and graphs, detailing methodology and findings. Amit reviews for clarity and accuracy. |\n| Create Interactive PowerPoint | Amit | To-Do | 2025-06-25 | Moderate Priority | Design an interactive PowerPoint presentation summarizing findings. Incorporate feedback from Cat on layout and content. |\n| Film Presentation | Cat & Amit | To-Do | 2025-06-27 | Low Priority | Jointly record the video presentation. Cat handles setup; Amit ensures script alignment with slides. |\n| Edit Presentation | Amit | To-Do | 2025-06-29 | Low Priority | Edit the video for clarity and polish. Share with Cat for final approval before submission. |\n| Final Project Submission | Cat & Amit | To-Don | 2025-06-30 | Low Priority | Make any last minute changes and submit the final project with mutual sign-off from both the team members. |\n",
