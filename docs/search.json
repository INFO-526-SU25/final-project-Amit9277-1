    "text": "Analysis plan\nData cleanup: after using clean_names(), we anticipate that data cleanup will only require ignoring NA values in the dataset.\n\nQ1 Plan:\nWe’ll first count, for each country, how many times each route was attempted and how many of those attempts succeeded. Then we’ll make a bar chart where:\n\nX-axis is the route name (categorical)\nY-axis is the number of attempts (numeric)\nBar fill shows the success rate (e.g. darker = higher percentage of summits)\nFacets split the chart by nation so each country has its own panel\n\nThis layout lets us instantly see which routes each country prefers (tallest bars) and how well they do on them (color intensity). We can then tweak—say, switch to a heatmap of nation vs. route with attempts as tile size and success rate as color—if we want another perspective.\nThe variables involved in this graph are as follows:\nExisting variables:\nnation (Categorical) - Principle nationality.\nroute1,…,route4 (Categorical) - Climbing route.\nsuccess1,….,success4 (Binary/Numeric) - Success on route.\nNew variables to be created:\nroute (categorical) - A single “long” route identifier created by pivoting route1–route4 into one column.\nsuccess (binary/numeric) - Corresponding to each route, the matching success flag (0 = fail, 1 = success).\nattempts (numeric) - Count of expeditions per (nation, route) pair.\nsuccess_rate (numeric, 0-1) - For each (nation, route):\n\\[\n\\text{success\\_rate} = \\frac{\\text{total successes}}{\\text{total attempts}}\n\\]\n\n\nQ2 Plan:\nWe anticipate that the best way to answer this question is to have a graph with percent total death by agency. These graphs will be faceted by season. To account for the difference in number of traveling done by season, we plan to adverage the percent death values. So far, a bar graph is the anticipated result though we are open to trying different types of graphs. If a bar graph is the final graph, we will use a stacked bar chart that shows what portion of the total death by agency is hiker or member deaths.\nThe variables involved in this graph are as follows:\nExisting variables:\n\nagency - Trekking agency\nmdeaths - Member deaths (per trip)\ntotmembers - total members (per trip)\nhdeaths - hired personnel deaths (per trip)\ntothired - total hired personnel (per trip)\nyear - year\nseason_factor - season\nNew variables to be created:\n\npmdeaths - mdeaths/totmembers - percent member deaths\nphdeaths -hdeaths/tothired -percent personnel deaths\nptotdeaths - (hdeaths+ mdeaths)/(tothired + totmembers ) - percent total deaths\nFor each season, we will annotate temperature and weather conditions which will be researched from internet sources. This may require a second graph that colors based on route. If this is the case, we will also require the variable: route1,…,route4"
