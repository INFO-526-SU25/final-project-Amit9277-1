# Himalayan Expeditions from 2021 to 2024

## Introduction

Dataset: The History of Himalayan Mountaineering Expeditions from Tidytuesday, taken from the archive by Elizabeth Hawley from the Himalayan Dataset.

Questions:

-   Are certain routes favored by expeditions from particular nations, and do they have disparate success rates?

-   Do certain Agencies have a higher number of member/personal deaths than others with respect to season/date?

# Question One: Are certain routes favored by expeditions from particular nations, and do they have disparate success rates?

## Variables

## Graph(s)

## Analysis

# Question Two: Do certain Agencies have a higher number of member/personal deaths than others with respect to season/date?

## Variables

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Existing variables

-   agency - Trekking agency

-   mdeaths - Member deaths (per trip)

-   totmembers - total members (per trip)

-   hdeaths - hired personnel deaths (per trip)

-   tothired - total hired personnel (per trip)

-   year - year

-   season_factor - season
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
New variables

-   pmdeaths - *mdeaths*/*totmembers* - percent member deaths

-   phdeaths -*hdeaths*/*tothired* -percent personnel deaths

-   ptotdeaths - (*hdeaths*+ *mdeaths*)/(*tothired* + *totmembers* ) - percent total deaths

or in two columns

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
penguins |> 
  head() |>
  kableExtra::kable() |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Images

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs. ::::::::: ::::::::::
